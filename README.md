Whether you're just starting out or looking to refine your expertise, these exercises provide a fun and accessible way to learn. So, grab your keyboard and let's dive in!

1. What is the distribution of patient ages within the hospital's database?
   - **Approach**: Use the SQL `SELECT` statement with the `COUNT` and `GROUP BY` functions to count the number of patients in different age groups.

2. How many patients were admitted to the hospital each month over the past year?
   - **Approach**: Utilize the SQL `SELECT` statement with the `COUNT` function and extract the month from admission dates using the `EXTRACT` function or date functions like `MONTH()`.

3. What is the average length of stay for patients admitted to the hospital?
   - **Approach**: Calculate the average length of stay by subtracting admission dates from discharge dates and then using the `AVG` function.

4. What is the readmission rate for patients within 30 days of discharge?
   - **Approach**: Use SQL `JOIN` to link admissions for the same patient, filter for readmissions within 30 days, and calculate the readmission rate.

5. How many beds are occupied in each department on average per day?
   - **Approach**: Use SQL `JOIN` to link admissions with department information, calculate the number of occupied beds for each day, and then compute the average.

6. Which medications are most frequently prescribed to patients?
   - **Approach**: Join prescription data with medication information, use `GROUP BY` to aggregate prescription counts, and order by the count to find the most frequently prescribed medications.

7. How many diagnostic tests were ordered by each department last month?
   - **Approach**: Join test orders with department information, filter for orders within the last month, and use `GROUP BY` to count the number of tests per department.

8. What is the mortality rate for patients with a specific diagnosis?
   - **Approach**: Count the number of patients with the specific diagnosis who died and divide by the total number of patients with that diagnosis.

9. What are the average response times for nursing staff in each department?
   - **Approach**: Calculate the difference between the time a request is made and the time it's responded to, and then compute the average response time for each department.

10. How much does each department contribute to the hospital's total expenses?
    - **Approach**: Join expenses data with department information, use `SUM` to calculate total expenses for each department, and then calculate the percentage contribution to total expenses.

11. When was the last maintenance performed on critical medical equipment?
    - **Approach**: Use SQL `MAX` function to find the latest maintenance date for each equipment type.

12. What are the current inventory levels for essential medical supplies?
    - **Approach**: Query the inventory table to retrieve current stock levels for essential supplies.

13. How long do patients typically wait for appointments with specialists?
    - **Approach**: Calculate the difference between appointment scheduling dates and appointment dates for specialist visits, and then compute the average wait time.

14. How many patient safety incidents were reported last quarter?
    - **Approach**: Filter incidents by date range and count the number of incidents reported.

15. How does the performance of each physician compare in terms of patient outcomes?
    - **Approach**: Aggregate patient outcomes (e.g., mortality rates) by physician and compare across physicians.

16. What are the average wait times for patients in the emergency department?
    - **Approach**: Calculate the difference between arrival times and admission times for emergency department visits and then compute the average wait time.

17. How much revenue was generated from outpatient services last year?
    - **Approach**: Filter billing data for outpatient services and sum the revenue for the specified period.

18. Which patients are at high risk for readmission based on their medical history?
    - **Approach**: Use predictive analytics techniques or predefined risk assessment models to identify high-risk patients based on medical history.

19. How many patients are scheduled for surgery next month, and what are their risk profiles?
    - **Approach**: Query surgery schedules for the next month and join with patient risk profiles to obtain relevant information.

20. How should resources be allocated to maximize patient outcomes and operational efficiency?
    - **Approach**: Use historical data analysis and predictive modeling to identify patterns and optimize resource allocation strategies accordingly.
